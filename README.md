Code and data for manuscript on the genetic and ecological differences between cryptic species in the Sphagnum magellanicum complex.
The projects consist of three subprojects:
01_HMSC: Run a Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities to study the drivers of distribution at macro- and micro-scale. To be run as an usual R script.
02_SDMs: Run an ensemble of Species Distribution Models to estimate current and past (Last Glacial Maximum) distribution of the species. To be run as a Targets workflow using the targets R-package.
03_Niche_overlap: Run an overlap analysis between the climatic niches of the species. This was a adhoc analysis as requested by one of the reviewers, although it was not finally included in the main body of the manuscript. This is also to be run as a Targets workflow using the targets R-package.

Citation: To be disclosed :)
